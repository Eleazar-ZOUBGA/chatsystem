# InsaChat : Communication System for Businesses

- `Introduction`

Welcome to our communication system for businesses. This system uses an agent to facilitate the exchange of messages between users. It is designed for organizations representing a group of people who share a common interest and collaborate together.

- `Installation`

To install the system, you will first need to install the agent on the workstations of the people who will be interacting. To do this, follow the instructions below:

    => mvn compile : to compile the code

    => mvn package : to all the classes and create a single jar file

    => mvn test : for running all the test classes for the project
    
    => mvn exec:java  : to execute the project.


- `Usage`

Once installation is complete, the system is ready to be used. Users can begin using the agent to exchange messages with each other.
An ID is automatically attributed to the user. The user needs to enter a pseudonyme and then choose a contact to chat.

When a user uses our system he can:

-Change his pseudo

-Send messages to a specific user

-Detect and take into account users' connections and disconnections in real-time


- `Support`

If you encounter any problems during installation or usage of the system, please contact technical support for assistance at wzoubga@insa-toulouse.fr or fornaro@insa-toulouse.fr
